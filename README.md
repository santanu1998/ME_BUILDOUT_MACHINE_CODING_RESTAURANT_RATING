# Machine Coding - Restaurant Rating

## Overview

#### Everyone uses zomato or swiggy, but have you ever seen how restaurant rating systems work? Design a restaurant rating platform with the features given below.

### During this Micro-Experience, the developer:

* Users should be able to register to give ratings ( 1 to 5 )  for restaurants.

* Users can add optional dish name(s) and rating descriptions along with a rating. Basically, It is a review.

* Fetch reviews for a restaurant based on filter and order conditions mentioned below:

* Filter reviews based on a range of ratings ( e.g., Filter reviews that have a rating between 2 and 5 )

* Display ratings in ascending or descending order The default order is to display ratings in descending order List restaurants based on descending order of (average) rating.

* During this Micro-Experience, the developer:

* Set up a new Project with the required classes.

* Understand the application requirements and implement the problem statement from scratch.

* Tested the implementation with test cases to ensure correctness.

## Implement Restaurant Rating from Scratch

### Scope of Work

* Clearly understand the Problem Statement Requirements.

* Identify the system's Primary Use Cases / Behaviour.

* Identify the Key Objects / Entities from the listed use cases.

* Implement entities with the identified attributes and their behavior.

* Implement the relationship between the entities.

* Write good quality tests for entities that cover all the appropriate behavior.

* Implement services & repositories layer of QContest adhering to the SOLID principles.

* Follow Test Driven Development to ensure correctness and better code coverage. 

### Skills used

#### Object Oriented Design, Java, Python, Unit Testing, Design Patterns, SOLID Principles
